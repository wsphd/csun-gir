## Introduction/Background

* Some $\frac{n_i}{N}$ needs are $\le$ contemporary desktop/laptop and software
  * But double-check new methodologies and growth (and movement) of data

* Some $\frac{n_j}{N}$ needs are $\gt$ contemporary desktop/laptop and software
  * Essentially, "compute-intensive, data-intensive, network-intensive"
  * Use FOSS (Linux, Open Source, etc.) to complement COTS (Windows, SPSS, etc.)

* Public Cloud (AWS, GCP, MS-Azure, OCI, Digital Ocean, etc.)
  * Use "free-tier"
  * Pubchase credits w/ a credit card

* Or?
  * NSF-funded, multi-year, inter-institution, STEAM/SocialSTEM, R3s/CCC's too

## Jetstream2

* Managed by Indiana University

* 100's of GiB of RAM, 10's of PB of disk, 10's of [GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit), fast networks
  * Best for new learners, data science projects (R, Python, Julia, etc.), large simulations, gateway to other systems, including several supercomputers around the country

* Need an "ACCESS ID"
  * Like an ORCID ID but for Research Computing
  * Have CV or Resume for upload (don't worry, your request will be approved)

* Be willing to learn:
  * How to ask (nicely and well, for more (incrementally) resources, and read a simple dashboard
  * the Command line and Linux
  * Webshell
  * SSH for logging int (and some learning curve for generating SSH keys and passphrases)
  * SCP for file transfer (after the SSH process is done)

## Nautilus (part of the National Research Platform--NRP)

* Managed by University of California, San Diego

* 100's of GiB of RAM, 10's of PB of disk, 100's of [GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)/[FPGAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)/[TPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit)/[DPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing_unit), very fast networks
  * Best for leading-edge science and engineering, especially w/ funded labs and staff

* Be willing to learn:
  * Must be comfortable with the Command Line, Open Source, and Linux
  * Kubernetes (open source client-server), you use the "kubectl" binary
  * You control just about everyting with ASCII ".yaml" files

* Start here:
  * Send Wayne an email - <ws@csun.edu>
